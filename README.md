# FSM

## CFP-FSM 
- Simple C-style function-pointer - finite state machine.

## OOP-FSM
- Templated object oriented programming - finite state machine...

## Testing Platform
- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.
- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 
- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

### In Development
